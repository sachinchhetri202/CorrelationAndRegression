Basic Information about this program.

It displays the following items:

2. Print (to the console) the average MinTemp based on month (you should display 12 values).
3. Display this information in a bar chart (or histogram) using the 'matplotlib' or 'plotly' package. (Documentation and examples: https://matplotlib.org/Links to an external site. and https://plotly.com/python/Links to an external site.)
4. Answer the following questions (print to the console):
- How many unique cities are in the dataset?
- Print out the top five rainiest (highest average RainFall) cities.
- Print out at least five different univariate values (e.g. mean of Pressure9am, mode of Humidity, etc.). Print out at least five, but feel free to print out more. The most important point is to gain insight into the data.
